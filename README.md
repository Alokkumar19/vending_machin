This repository contains a Verilog testbench for a Mealy Machine-based vending machine that:
  Accepts cash input.
  Checks item availability and price.
  Dispenses items and change.
  Handles cancellations and errors (insufficient cash, unavailable items).

The testbench verifies the FSM logic by running four test cases covering normal and edge-case scenarios.
